**Save Daily. Keep the Streak.**

s through commitment stakes, penalties, and community rewards.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

People have always struggled to build and maintain new habits, particularly around financial discipline. Traditional savings apps lack sufficient incentive mechanisms to ensure long-term commitment. Our research shows that **loss aversion is a more powerful motivator than potential gains** - people fear losing $100 more than they desire gaining $100.

**Savelo harnesses years of behavioral psychology research to make saving an achievable habit by:**

- Creating financial consequences for missed commitments
- Providing immediate accountability through blockchain transparency
- Rewarding successful completion with community-driven incentives
- Gamifying the savings process with streaks and social features

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. **Commitment Contract**

- Users create a saving plan with daily amounts and duration
- **Penalty stake** required upfront (skin in the game)
- Stakes are locked in smart contracts until completion

### 2. **Behavioral Psychology Features**

- **Loss Aversion**: Penalty stake creates immediate loss fear
- **Grace Period**: 2-day buffer for first missed payment (realistic flexibility)
- **Progressive Penalties**: 10% of daily amount deducted per missed day
- **Social Proof**: Community leaderboards and shared success

### 3. **Reward Mechanisms**

- **20% Completion Bonus**: Extra reward for finishing the plan
- **Community Reward Pool**: Failed participants' penalties distributed to successful savers
- **Streak Tracking**: Visual progress and achievement badges
- **Compound Returns**: Larger stakes earn proportionally larger community rewards

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PNPM (recommended) or npm
- MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Celo network setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fairway-global/p2p-lending-onchain-ethglobal-hackathon.git
cd p2p-lending-onchain-ethglobal-hackathon
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Copy environment templates
cp apps/web/.env.template apps/web/.env
cp apps/contracts/.env.template apps/contracts/.env

# Add your private key and RPC URLs to .env files
```

4. **Run the development server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser

### Testing

```bash
# Run smart contract tests
pnpm contracts:test

# Test coverage
cd apps/contracts
npx hardhat coverage
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a Saving Plan

```typescript
// Example: Save 5 TST daily for 7 days with 0.5 TST penalty stake
const plan = await createPlan(
  tokenAddress,    // TST token
  "5",            // 5 tokens daily
  7,              // 7 days duration
  "0.5"           // 0.5 token penalty stake
);
```

### Daily Payment Flow

```typescript
// 1. Approve tokens for contract
await approveToken(tokenAddress, dailyAmount);

// 2. Make daily payment
await payDaily(planId);
```

### Reward Calculation

- **Savings**: 5 TST × 7 days = 35 TST
- **Completion Bonus**: 35 TST × 20% = 7 TST
- **Penalty Stake Return**: 0.5 TST
- **Community Pool Share**: Variable (based on failed plans)
- **Total Return**: ~42.5+ TST

## 🔬 Behavioral Psychology Research

Our platform is built on proven psychological principles:

### **Loss Aversion** (Kahneman & Tversky)

- People weigh losses ~2x more heavily than equivalent gains
- Upfront penalty stakes create immediate loss fear
- More effective than traditional "carrot" incentives

### **Commitment Devices** (Behavioral Economics)

- Pre-commitment reduces decision fatigue
- Financial stakes increase follow-through rates
- Social accountability amplifies commitment

### **Variable Reward Schedules**

- Community reward pools create unpredictable bonuses
- Streak tracking provides consistent positive reinforcement
- Achievement badges satisfy completion psychology
